# mohid_matlab_tools

The goal of this repository is to gather all the matlab code already develope from mohid matlab users, to save some time in postprocessing, and to start creating new tools.

You are welcome to contribute, the idea is to create examples for users to visualize mohid oputput, also to validate their model with obervations and adding some statistic to it. 

Go to the tools directory we will be adding support as we need it.

Tools:

  - Validate_ADCP: data and been able to do some statistic while validating the Mohid with ADCP. It will requiere some Matlab inside to adapat to your needs. 


- Read_drifter: It reads drifter data and extract lagrangian velocities and anlges to plot it (under development)
